# Algorithm Interview Questions + Answers

This repository contains C++ code that solves algorithm questions that gets asked in interviews. This repo will be continuously updated with more questions and answers (hopefully).

### Repo Structure

The list of questions can be found in the next section. The answers to those questions will be found in a folder of this repository with the corresponding name.

The solution will be written in C++ in a file named `main.cpp` within the folder.

Additionally, a blogpost will pictures and alternative solutions can be found on my website, and a youtube video explaining the algorithm (usually talking through the answers with pictures) can be found on my youtube channel. Reading the C++ code without context probably won't help, so it's highly recommended to watch the youtube video to understand the solution.

#### Running The Code

After cloning the repository, cd into the folder for the algorithm you want to run. 
(Ex. `cd MoveZeroesToEndOfArray`)

Then run the make file which will compile the code with GCC (C++11) using:

```
make
```
